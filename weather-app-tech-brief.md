# Technical Brief: Dark Sky-Inspired Weather PWA

Based on your requirements and the Dark Sky UI inspiration you've shown, here's a comprehensive technical brief for building a personal weather PWA that emphasizes the features you value most.

## Project Architecture Overview

### **Core Technology Stack**

**Frontend Framework**: **Vue 3 + Vite**[^1][^2][^3]

- Vue offers the gentlest learning curve while providing modern reactivity
- Vite provides fast development builds and hot module replacement
- Excellent PWA support with Vue CLI PWA plugin
- Component-based architecture perfect for weather widgets

**Mapping Library**: **Leaflet + Custom Weather Layers**[^4][^5][^6]

- Lightweight, battle-tested mapping solution
- Excellent OpenWeatherMap integration examples[^5][^6]
- RainViewer API compatibility for radar overlays[^7][^4]
- Touch-friendly for mobile interactions

**State Management**: **Pinia** (Vue's recommended store)

- Simple, intuitive state management
- Perfect for managing weather data, location state, and UI preferences
- TypeScript support for better development experience

**Styling**: **Tailwind CSS + CSS Grid/Flexbox**

- Rapid UI development with utility classes
- Excellent for responsive design patterns
- Easy to implement Dark Sky's clean, minimal aesthetic

## Feature Implementation Strategy

### **1. Core Weather Data Architecture**

**Data Flow Pattern**:

```
Location Input → API Aggregator → Local Cache → UI Components
```

**API Integration Strategy**:

- **Primary**: OpenWeatherMap One Call API 3.0 for comprehensive data[^8][^9]
- **Radar**: RainViewer API for precipitation overlay[^7][^10]
- **Backup**: Visual Crossing for redundancy[^11][^12]

**Data Structure Design**:

```javascript
// Central weather state
const weatherState = {
  currentLocation: { lat: 0, lng: 0, name: '' },
  currentWeather: { temp, conditions, precipitation, wind, etc. },
  hourlyForecast: [], // 48 hours
  dailyForecast: [], // 10 days
  radarData: { current, forecast, historical },
  alerts: []
}
```

### **2. UI Component Breakdown**

**Primary View Components**:

- `CurrentWeatherCard`: Large temperature display with current conditions
- `PrecipitationChart`: Vertical timeline showing rain intensity/timing
- `HourlyForecast`: Scrollable vertical list with weather metrics tabs
- `DailyAccordion`: Expandable daily summaries
- `LocationSearch`: Autocomplete search with geolocation support

**Secondary Components**:

- `RadarView`: Full-screen map with scrubber controls
- `SettingsPanel`: Units, refresh intervals, data sources
- `MetricsToggle`: Switch between temperature, precipitation, wind, UV, etc.

### **3. Offline Strategy \& Caching**

**Service Worker Caching Strategy**:

- **App Shell**: Cache-first for HTML, CSS, JS assets[^13][^14][^15]
- **Weather Data**: Stale-while-revalidate for current conditions[^15][^16][^13]
- **Radar Images**: Network-first with 1-hour expiration[^17][^15]

**Data Storage Architecture**:

```javascript
// IndexedDB structure for offline support
const weatherDB = {
  locations: [], // Saved locations with last update time
  forecasts: [], // Cached forecast data with timestamps
  radarCache: [], // Recent radar image tiles
  userPreferences: {} // Settings, units, favorite locations
}
```

**Offline Behavior**:

- Show cached data immediately with "Last updated" timestamps[^18][^19]
- Queue location searches for when online[^19][^18]
- Graceful degradation: disable radar when offline, keep forecasts

### **4. PWA Configuration**

**Manifest Configuration**:[^20][^21][^22]

```json
{
  "name": "Personal Weather App",
  "short_name": "Weather",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#1e293b",
  "background_color": "#0f172a",
  "start_url": "/?source=pwa",
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icons/192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" },
    { "src": "/icons/512.png", "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png", "purpose": "maskable" }
  ]
}
```

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Core Weather Data (Week 1-2)**

- Set up Vue 3 + Vite development environment
- Implement OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Build basic weather data fetching and state management
- Create responsive layout foundation

### **Phase 2: Essential UI Components (Week 2-3)**

- Develop current weather display
- Build hourly forecast with vertical scrolling
- Implement precipitation timeline chart
- Add location search and geolocation

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)**

- Integrate Leaflet mapping with radar overlay
- Build radar scrubber controls
- Implement daily forecast accordion
- Add weather metrics tabbing (temp/precip/wind/UV)

### **Phase 4: PWA \& Polish (Week 4-5)**

- Implement service worker with caching strategies
- Add IndexedDB for offline data storage
- Configure PWA manifest and installation prompts
- Performance optimization and error handling

## Technical Considerations for Personal Use

### **Simplified Architecture Benefits**

- **No Authentication**: Skip user accounts, use localStorage for preferences
- **Single User Optimization**: Aggressive caching without multi-user concerns
- **Direct API Integration**: No backend required, APIs called directly from frontend
- **Local-First Design**: IndexedDB as primary data store with API as sync source

### **Development Shortcuts**

- **Hardcoded Sensible Defaults**: Chicago coordinates, Fahrenheit units, 12-hour time
- **Simplified Error Handling**: Console logging instead of comprehensive error reporting
- **Minimal Testing**: Manual testing focus since it's personal use
- **Rapid Iteration**: Vite's HMR allows immediate feedback during development

### **Performance Optimizations**

- **Lazy Loading**: Radar component loads only when requested
- **Request Debouncing**: Limit API calls during rapid location searches
- **Image Optimization**: WebP radar tiles with fallbacks
- **Bundle Splitting**: Separate chunks for maps and core app

## Deployment Strategy

**Hosting**: **Vercel or Netlify**

- Zero-config deployment from Git repository
- Automatic HTTPS and CDN distribution
- Perfect for PWA static hosting needs

**Domain**: Custom domain for better PWA installation experience

- Enables proper manifest recognition
- Improves perceived legitimacy for installation prompts

**CI/CD**: Simple GitHub Actions workflow

- Auto-deploy on main branch push
- Build optimization and asset minification
- Service worker generation with Workbox

This architecture provides a solid foundation for recreating the Dark Sky experience as a personal PWA. The technology choices balance modern development practices with simplicity, ensuring you can build and maintain the app efficiently while achieving the smooth, responsive weather experience you're looking for.

The vertical scrolling UI, precipitation charts, and radar integration will closely match your preferred Dark Sky workflow, while the PWA architecture ensures it works reliably offline and installs like a native app on your devices.
